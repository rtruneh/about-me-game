    <p> My name is Rosa. I am a mother of an amazing young man that teaches me things about life and myself, daily. 
        I grew up like an army brat, without actually being in the army. I moved quite a lot in my educational career, 
        split between Philadelphia and Seattle. I graduated from MTSU with a BA in Accounting with a minor in business 
        admin. When I moved from Seattle, none of my credits transfered over to TN schools and had to start all the 
        way over again. In the midst of attending MTSU, I became pregnant with my son which lead to me being in school 
        for a long time!! The only thing that matters is that I finished!! I was blessed enough to find a job that 
        allowed me to work within the accounting field and grow and learn before I even graduated. I began my career 
        with this company as a barista and 10 years later ended it as a staff accountant. This company became family 
        as I've had many firsts while there; my child, graduated college, purchased my first home and a new car.</p>
